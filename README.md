# Effective estimation of image rotation angle using spectral method

The authors of paper [1], provide this MATLAB toolbox only for research purposes
(evaluation and comparison of this method with other methods).

It contains:

- `EstimateAngle.m`:    main function to estimate rotation angle using the proposed method in [1]
- `Example.m`:     example of usage of the method
- `CentralCrop.m`     util function to perform central cropping operation
- `Lena.tiff`:     test image (downloaded from the USC-SIPI image database)
- `README.md`:     this readme info
